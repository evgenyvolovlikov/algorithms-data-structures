### Data Structure: Arrays also called Lists
```
const strings= ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Variable array is somewhere in memory and the computer knows it.
When I do array[2], i'm telling the computer, hey go to the array and grab the 3rd item from where the array is stored.

string[2] -> O(1)

strings.push('e') -> O(n)

strings.pop() -> O(1)

strings.unshift('x') -> O(n)

strings.splice(2, 0, 'alien') -> O(n)

console.log(strings)
```
